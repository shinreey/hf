  <body>
    <p> Today, I forgot my lunch.  I will be pretty hungry come lunchtime.  There are a few choices here in Downtown.  I enjoy a large variety of food.  Here are some foods I enjoy: 
    <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
      <li>Chinese</li>
      <li>Mexican</li>
      <li>Mediterranean</li>
      <li>Burgers</li>
      <li>Salads</li>
    </ul>
